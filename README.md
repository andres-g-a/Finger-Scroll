# Finger-Scroll
The idea behind this project is to study how the MediaPipe hand tracking library developed by Google works and how to integrate it in an accessible way for a task as simple as moving around a map. 

## How to use

- Create a new virtual environment.

- Install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Open the map of the city or town you want in the Google Map web application.

- Run ```python scroll.py``` and switch to the tab with the previously opened map.

You will now be able to move around the map simply by pointing with your index finger.
